## Usage

This plugin is shipped in a [UMD format](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), meaning that it is available as a CommonJS/AMD module or browser global.

For example, when using CommonJS modules:

```js
var bespoke = require('bespoke'),
  scale = require('bespoke-scale');

bespoke.from('article', [
  scale()
]);
```

When using browser globals:

```js
bespoke.from('article', [
  bespoke.plugins.scale()
]);
```

By default, bespoke-scale detects which method to use for resizing slides. In browsers that support it, CSS `zoom` is used. In all other browsers, the slides are wrapped with an element with a `bespoke-scale-parent` class, which is resized with CSS transforms. If the plugin option is 'transform', this element is wrapped around each slide individually. If the plugin option is 'transform-group', a single wrapper element is added around the whole group of slides. You'll need to provide styles for the wrapper element when using the transform scaling method. For example:

```css
.bespoke-scale-parent {
  perspective: 600px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
}
```

If you'd like to specify which scaling method to use, you can pass `'zoom'`, `'transform'` or `'transform-group'` as an option, for example:

```js
bespoke.from('article', [
  scale('zoom')
]);
```
